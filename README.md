# Paper Statistics Demo

## How to use

### Run Static WebSite

The static site contains all the information of collected conferences. If you don't want to browse GPU performance comparison, then this is all you need.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/milesxu/paper-topic-model
cd paper-topic-model
git checkout single-gpu
cd static/paper-app
npm install
ng serve
```

Be sure you have node.js and npm installed. After that, you can open a web browser and input address: localhost:4200. If nothing is wrong, you will see the demo home page.
